  "readme": "# ardrone-webflight\n\nPilot the AR.Drone 2.0 directly from your browser. Extend the application with plugins\nto add features such as video recording, autonomous flight, face recognition, and more.\nIt makes it a very friendly environment to quickly build and experiment with your drone\n(e.g. during a [nodecopter](http://nodecopter.com) event).\n\nIf you encounter an issue; please submit it to the issue tracker! You can also catch\nup with me (eschnou) on twitter or on #freenode (channel #nodecopter).\n\n**This branch is the development branch, there are no packaged release yet.**\n\n## Built-in plugins\n\n* **[video-png](plugins/video-png/)** stream the video to the browser through static image loading,\n    works great in every browser. Requires ffmpeg installed on your system.\n\n* **[video-stream](plugins/video-stream/)** use [node-dronestream](https://github.com/bkw/node-dronestream) to stream the raw h264 video\nfeed via webscokets and rendering in Javascript !!! Need a modern browser and CPU.\n\n* **[hud](plugins/hud/)** to visualize a head-up display with artificial horizon, compass,\n    altimeter, etc. Based on [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit)\n\n* **[pilot](plugins/pilot)** to control the drone remotely using the keyboard. Based on [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser).\n\n* **[battery](plugins/battery)** display a battery widget in the top bar.\n\n* **[blackbox](plugins/blackbox)** records all mission data (raw video, navdata, etc.) on the disk.\n\n* **[replay](plugins/replay)** replays a mission by injecting the data at the client level. Makes it a very\nfriendly tool to code/test/debug when you can't fly. **You need to use video-png for video, not compatible with video-stream yet.**\n\n\n## Other plugins\n\nFeel free to add your plugins in this list by editing this page.\n\n* **[copterface](https://github.com/eschnou/webflight-copterface)** detect faces and track them by rotating the drone. \nA port of the [copterface](https://github.com/paulhayes/copterface) project to the webflight environment.\n\n* **[traffic](https://github.com/wiseman/webflight-traffic)** displays live Air traffic from ADS-B data as an augmented reality overlay.\n\n* **[gamepad](https://github.com/wiseman/webflight-gamepad)** controls the drone with a gamepad.\n\n* **[tracker](https://github.com/bkw/webflight-tracker)** track pixels on the videostream by clicking on them.\n\n## Install\n\nWebFlight requires a recent nodejs (built and tested with node > 0.10) as well as\n[npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management.\n\nIn order to use the video-png plugin, you also need ffmpeg installed on your system.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/eschnou/ardrone-webflight.git\ncd ardrone-webflight\nnpm install\nbower install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Copy the config.js.sample to config.js and edit to select your plugins\n2. Connect to the drone's wifi\n3. Run `node app.js`\n4. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/\n\n\n### Controlling the drone\n\nIf you have enabled the **pilot** plugin, you can fly the drone with the following keys. You can define your keyboard in the \nconfig file. In the plugin, `azerty` and `qwerty` keyboards are defined.  Feel free to define others.\n\nUse `z, s, q, d` to move front, back and sideways. Use your `cursors` to go up/down or turn\nclockwise/counter clockwise. Use `t` to takeoff and `l` for landing.\n\nUse the `tab` key to toggle acceleration speed slow/fast.\n\nUse the `f` key to perform a flip in the current direction of movement.\n\n### Record a mission\n\nJust press the `r` to start recording. A popup alers you when the recording starts. Press `r` again to stop. Each mission\nis bundled in its own folder.\n\n## Adding your own plugin\n\nThere is no tutorial yet, in the meanwhile, just have a look at the built in plugins,\nit is faily straightforward.\n\n## Thanks\n\nThis work is based on the integration of [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit)\nand [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser), refactored in a plugin architecture.\nThanks to [@bkw](https://github.com/bkw/) and [@functino](https://github.com/functino) for sharing! Also\na big thank you to [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge) for his [node-ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone) library\nwhich pushed me into buying a drone and become crazy about these little flying robots!\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 by the AUTHORS\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
